
This is a functional beta version of the new 
GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-in (Second Edition).

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/


Installation
------------

The recommended way is to use the Eclipse standard update mechanism:

Help -> Software Updated -> Available Software -> Add Site 

	http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates

(be sure you uncheck 'Group items by category' and later accept
the unsigned plug-in)

The alternate solution to the online site is to download the archive 
from SourceForge and to to point the Eclipse update mechanism to it
(Help -> Software Updated -> Available Software -> Add Site -> Archive).

A quick and dirty way is to extract the plug-in .jar file from the 
downloaded archive and to copy it to the .../eclipse/plugins directory,
but this is not recommended. 


Requirements
------------

- Eclipse 3.4
- CDT 5.0.2 (!)
- Java JRE 1.5
- Cygwin (note: although CodeSourcery provides cs-make, if the sources 
are organized in subdirectories, like 'src', the generated makefiles
require additional shell support, so having Cygwin in the build path
is a good choice).


Implementation notes
--------------------

Supported toolchains:
- The CodeSourcery G++ Lite on Windows (arm-none-eabi-gcc)
- The CodeSourcery G++ Lite on Linux (arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc)

- GNUARM and derivatives on Windows (arm-elf-gcc)
- GNUARM on Linux (arm-elf-gcc)
- GNUARM on Mac OS/X (arm-elf-gcc)

Supported project types are:
- applications (.elf, .hex)
- static libraries (.a)

The processor type can be selected for all tools in the "Target Processor"
section.
 
Creation of .HEX file, listing file and size report can be controlled from 
the "Additional Tools" section.

Debugging options for all tools were moved to a common "Debugging" section.

The assembly step is now done with the more general 'gcc' instead of 'as'.

Similarly, the link step is done by 'gcc/g++', instead of 'ld'.
