[2009-04-18]

- '-nostdlib' enabled by default for linkers

- 'CodeSourcery G++ Lite' for Windows toolchain presence tested (by 
attempting to execute 'arm-none-eabi-gcc') [experimental]

- 'CodeSourcery G++ Lite' for Linux toolchain presence tested (by 
attempting to execute 'arm-none-eabi-gcc') [experimental]

- 'GNUARM' (and derivatives) toolchain presence tested (by 
attempting to execute 'arm-elf-gcc') [experimental]

- PATH automatic discovery for Windows versions of 'CodeSourcery G++ Lite'
and 'GNUARM 4.1.1', by using Windows Registry information. No need to have 
them in the system PATH.


[2009-04-07]

- C Linker empty makefile bug fixed (spaces in secondaryOutputs/targetTool)

- about.* files moved here from the feature project; the ARM icon is now
visible in the Help -> About window.

- update site URL renamed from http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/update
to http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates


[2009-04-03]

- org.eclipse.cdt.core.templateAssociations (schema in org.eclipse.cdt.core)
points to all toolchain bases, as specified in schema examples and used in
org.eclipse.cdt.managebuilder.gnu.ui. (not yet functional)


[2009-04-07]

- Discovery Options implemented for all toolchains.


[2009-04-13]

- patches from Freddie Chopin applied
	- linker --gc-sections added
	- linker -nostartfiles enabled for C, disabled for C++
	- linker -nostdlibs disabled
	- C++ compiler -no-rtti option added
	- C/C++ compiler signed char as option, default is unsigned (compiler default)

- recompiled with Eclipse 3.5 & CDT 6.0


[2010-01-15]

- ported on Eclipse 3.5 SR1 (Galileo), with CDT 6.0


[2010-01-26]

- license changed from GPL to EPL


[2010-01-15]

- no functional changes, just a clean repack of the update site and
of the published archive.


[2010-04-20]

- the confusion between Host OS and Guest OS when selecting the 
CodeSourcery G++ Lite toolchain was finally sorted out. 
The basic toolchain when targeting for embedded systems is ARM EABI. 
The arm-none-eabi toolchain is intended to generate programs 
for running on ARM ported Linux, not embedded systems.


[2010-06-09]

- GNU/Linux CodeSourcery toolchain fixed
(changed from arm-none-linux-gnueabi-* to arm-none-eabi-*)


[2010-06-28]

- Properties on a source file triggered an error when selecting Tool Settings.
This was due to a bug in ARMManagedCommandLineGenerator, where the parent
of Tool may be ResourceConfiguration instead of ToolChain.


[2010-07-06]

- ported on Mac OS X, Eclipse 3.5.2
- CodeSourcery added to Mac OS X
- Mac OS X missing GNUARM configuration reference fixed
- (#3024374) individual properties processed; ITool.getParent() should climb up
the hierarchy via getSuperClass(); this is also a better fix for #3021757.
- (#3024483) New Yagarto Toolchain uses EABI; Yagarto toolchain split from 
common Windows GCC configurations
