- install Sun JRE1.5 or later

- from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/galileo/sr2 download and install 
	'Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers'

	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcpplug-developers/galileosr2
		(eclipse-rcp-galileo-SR2-*.*)

	(the general Eclipse download page is available at http://www.eclipse.org/downloads)

- Help -> Install New Software
	Work with the 'Galileo' update site, 
	'Programming Languages' section
		'Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools'

- Help -> Install New Software
	Add...
	http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/galileo 
	'CDT Main Features' section
		'Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools SDK'
	'CDT Optional Features'
		All

Notes: 
- without the CDT sources, the extension point schemas will not be available
so attempts to add new elements to the extensions will not be possible,
and only 'Generic' elements will be offered.
- the CDT Optional Features might not be mandatory, I added them to have all
available code at hand 


- Help -> Install New Software
	Work with 'Galileo' update site, 
	'Collaboration Tools' section
		'Subversive SVN Team Provider (Incubation)'

- Help -> Install New Software
	Add...
	http://community.polarion.com/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/
	'Subversive SVN Connectors' section
		All

Notes:
- although not all connectors work on all platforms, manually selecting some of them is
error prone, so better install all of them and let the Eclipse try to figure out which 
one to use

- Check if a value is filled in: Properties -> Team -> SVN -> Tab: SVN Connector

	- on Windows, you should see something like:
		'JavaHL 1.5.4 Win32 Binaries (Optional)'

	- on Mac, you should see something like:
		'SVN Kit 1.2.3'

	- on Linux, I think you should see something like:
		'SVN Kit 1.2.3'
	(sorry, I don't have it at hand) 

- create a new workspace
	File -> Switch Workspace -> Other
	enter path
	
- change the workspace preferences
	General -> Workspace
		disable Build automatically
		enable Refresh automatically
		enable Save automatically before rebuild
		Text file encoding: UTF-8


- File -> New -> New Project -> Project from SVN 

	General:
	URL: 'https://gnuarmeclipse.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuarmeclipse/'

	(the project should be checked out now)


- repeat for the following two more projects:
	org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-feature
	org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-updatesite

- check if the references in the org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu project were recognized.
Open the project and check if the following folders are populated
	JRE System Library
	Plug-in Dependencies are populated

- select the .gnu project
	Project properties -> Run/Debug Settings
	New -> Eclipse Application -> 
		Name: Eclipse GNU ARM Plug-in
		Location: ${workspace_loc}/../GNUARM-test
	Tab: Plug-ins
		Launch with: 'plug-ins selected below only'
		Select Workspace, org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu
		Deselect 'Target Platform'
		Deselect 'Add new workspace plug-ins to this launch configuration automatically'
		Press 'Add required Plug-ins'

- Select the *.gnu project
	Run -> Run As -> Eclipse Application -> Eclipse GNU ARM Plug-in
	Help -> About Eclipse Platform -> Installation Details -> Plug-ins
	(the 'GNU ARM C/C++ Development Support' must be present)


For each build
--------------

- go to the workspace org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-updatesite project
and remove
	features/* 
	plugins/* 
	artifacts.jar 
	content.jar

- back to Eclipse, the gnu-updatesite project
	open site.xml

- press the 'Build All' button
	since the sources were written on 3.4, you'll get about 84 warnings

- features/*.jar, plugins/*.jar, artifacts.jar and content.jar should be rebuild

- commit all three projects to SVN

- pack the update site to an archive
	- create a temporary directory 'updatesite' 
	- in file explorer enter directory 'updatesite'
	- svn export to the temporary directory, from
		https://gnuarmeclipse.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuarmeclipse/trunk/org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-updatesite
	- remove the .project file
	- pack the content of the directory into an archive called
		org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu_updatesite.0.5.3.201001151708.zip
	- copy it in workspace/deploy
	
- upload new release to Sourceforge files management services 	
	- go to 'https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=181918'
	- select folder 'gnuarmeclipse (CDT 5.x SE)'
	- create new folder with a name like '0.5.3.201001151708'
	- upload README.txt and (in Properties) mark it as 'Release note'
	- upload .zip file 
	- in Properties check Linux/Mac/Windows and assign release notes to it

- connect to Sourceforge and update web from SVN gnu-updatesite project
	$ ssh -t ilg-ul,gnuarmeclipse@shell.sourceforge.net create
	ilg-ul@shell-22005:~> ./gnuarm-updates.sh
	ilg-ul@shell-22005:~> exit
	$ ssh ilg-ul,gnuarmeclipse@shell.sourceforge.net shutdown
	check if newly built version was really published

    [other useful commands:
    	$ ssh ilg-ul,gnuarmeclipse@shell.sourceforge.net sf-help
		$ ssh -p 22005 ilg-ul@shell2.sourceforge.net
    (the port and address for the second ssh are taken from the 
    output of sf-help)]
