- install Sun JRE1.5 or later

- install Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers (eclipse-rcp-ganymede-SR2-win32.zip)

- DO NOT update to the latest versions of Plug-in Development (if you do so, 
launching Eclipse to test the plug-in might end with a strange error).

- add 'C and C++ Development' plug-ins from the 'Ganymede update site'

- add 'Eclipse C/C++ Development Tooling Source' from the CDT update site
http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/ganymede, Uncategorized

(without CDT sources the extension point schemas will not be available
so attempts to add new elements to the extensions will not be possible,
and only 'Generic' elements will be offered).

- add Subversive SVN plug-in (the first three; usually no need for 
the Uncategorized sources) from

http://download.eclipse.org/technology/subversive/0.7/update-site/


- add Polarion SVN connector plug-in (the first one; 
usually no need for the Uncategorized sources) from

http://community.polarion.com/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/

on Windows, install the Win connectors; on Linux DO NOT try to install them,
the default is the SVNKit.
 
(see Tortoise update site at
http://community.polarion.com/index.php?page=download&project=subversive)


- on Linux,
 
$ sudo apt-get install subversion 

if necessary, also install:

$ sudo apt-get install libsvn-java

and then add this to your eclipse.ini:

-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni

(step not confirmed, I did my development on Windows)

- create a new workspace

- change workspace preferences
	General -> Workspace
		disable Build automatically
		enable Refresh automatically
		enable Save automatically before rebuild
		Text file encoding: UTF-8

org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-feature
org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-updatesite

Select 'Head Revision'

press Finish 

Check Out As page:
select 'Check out as a project with the name specified', Depth: Recursively

press Finish

(the project should be checked out now)


- check if the references in the org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu project were recognized.
(open the project and check if JRE System Library and Plug-in Dependencies are populated)

- Run As -> Eclipse Application; close new Eclipse instance

- Project properties -> Run/Debug Settings -> Eclipse Application -> Edit

- in gnu-updatesite remove features/* plugins/* artifacts.xml content.xml

- open site.xml

- press the 'Build All' button
