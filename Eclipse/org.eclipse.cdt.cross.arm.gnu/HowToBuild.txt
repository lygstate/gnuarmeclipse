so attempts to add new elements to the extensions will not be possible,
and only 'Generic' elements will be offered).

on Windows, install:
	'JavaHL 1.5.4 Win32 Binaries (Optional)'
	'JavaHL 1.6.0 Win32 Binaries (Optional)'

<questionable>
on Linux, DO NOT try to install them, the default is the SVNKit.
 
	$ sudo apt-get install subversion 

	if necessary, also install:

	$ sudo apt-get install libsvn-java

	and then add this to your eclipse.ini:

	-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni

	(step not confirmed, I did my development on Windows)

- create a new workspace
	File -> Switch Workspace -> Other
	enter path
	
- change workspace preferences
	General -> Workspace
		disable Build automatically
		enable Refresh automatically
		enable Save automatically before rebuild
		Text file encoding: UTF-8


- File -> New -> New Project -> Project from SVN 

	General:
	URL: 'https://gnuarmeclipse.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuarmeclipse/'
	press Next 

	Select Resource
	Browse: gnuarmeclipse -> trunk

	iterate the following 3 projects:

		org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu
		org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-feature
		org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-updatesite

	Select 'Head Revision'

	press Finish 

	Check Out As page:
	select 'Check out as a project with the name specified', Depth: Recursively

	press Finish

	(the project should be checked out now)


- check if the references in the org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu project were recognized.
(open the project and check if JRE System Library and Plug-in Dependencies are populated)

- select .gnu project
	Project properties -> Run/Debug Settings
	New -> Eclipse Application -> 
		Name: Eclipse GNU ARM Plug-in
	Plug-ins Tab
		Launch with: 'plug-ins selected below only'
		Select Workspace, org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu
		Deselect 'Target Platform'
		Deselect 'Add new workspace plug-ins to this launch configuration automatically'

	Run -> Run As -> Eclipse Application -> Eclipse GNU ARM Plug-in
	Help -> About Eclipse Platform -> Installation Details -> Plug-ins

- in the file explorer go to the workspace location and 
in org.eclipse.cdt.cross.arm.gnu-updatesite remove
	features/* plugins/* artifacts.* content.*
from the filesystem, not from SVN (removing from Eclipse will try to
remove them from SVN too)


- back to Eclipse, the gnu-updatesite project
	open site.xml

- press the 'Build All' button
	since the sources were written on 3.4, you'll get about 84 warnings

- features/*.jar, plugins/*.jar, artifacts.jar and content.jar should be rebuild

- pack the content of gnu-updatesite into a .zip archive

- use this file as an archived update site
